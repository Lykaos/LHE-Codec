#	use a cache called distribution, so we know which symbol we need based on  #
#	the upper and the actual hop. It will also include a symbol compressor; we #
#	will use a symbol 'X' which means a variable '1' (null hops) chain each    #
#	time, based on the length of '1' chains we got before.                     #
#	Input: Hops list, width, height and number of pixels of the image.         #
